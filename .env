# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FULL_IMAGE_TAG is used as an environment variable in docker-compose.yaml.
#
# Most scripts like `dcbuild`, `dcup`, and `dcrun` explicitly set this variable
# before calling `docker compose`, so its value in this .env file is overridden
# in those cases. This ensures that the correct image tag is passed into
# the Compose configuration dynamically.
#
# However, some scripts like `dcdown`, `dcstop`, and `dcstart` do NOT set this
# variable — and Compose will warn:
#   "The FULL_IMAGE_TAG variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string."
#
# To suppress this warning and prevent any unexpected behavior, we provide a
# safe fallback here. This value is just a placeholder and will not affect any
# script that properly sets the variable.
#
# ✅ DO NOT change this value unless you know exactly what you're doing.
# ✅ It is safe and expected for this to be "unset".
